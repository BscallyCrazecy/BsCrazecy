      <p class="shoe-par">
        The Marikina Shoe Museum is located in Marikina in the centre-north of the Philippines. Before it became a shoe museum, it was used as an arsenal during the Spanish Period, then a detention cell during the Filipino-American War. It was later used during the American Regime as a motor pool for American soldiers. After World War Two, it was used as a rice mill.
Imelda Marcos's shoe collection had been on display at the Malacañang Palace Museum (now called the Presidential Museum and Library) for six years before it was placed into storage. Marikina is the shoe-making centre of the Philippines, and in 1998, the Marikina city Mayor Bayani Fernando suggested that a museum be opened that was dedicated to Marikina's shoe industry.
After renovation works in the late 1990s were completed, the museum was opened as Marikina Footwear Museum in 2001. Imelda Marcos herself led the museum's opening.

        Kapitan Moy Building, also known as Cultural Center of Marikina situated in Marikina, Metro Manila, the Philippines, is the 200-year-old house of Don Laureano Guevarra (July 4, 1851 - December 30, 1891), known as the founder of the Marikina shoe industry. Also known as Kapitan Moy, he served as capitan municipal in the former municipality. A historical marker honoring him as the "Pioneer of the Shoe-making Industry in Marikina" was installed at his birthplace in 1970. Presently, there are two restaurants found in the ground floor of the Kapitan Moy Building and these are Café Kapitan Restaurant and Kusina ni Kambal. At the Café Kapitan Restaurant is an old well which serves as a décor and a wishing well to customers.

        The Diocesan Shrine and Parish of Nuestra Señora de los Desamparados, commonly known as Marikina Church, is a Roman Catholic church in Marikina, the Philippines. The church enshrines one of several images of the Madonna and Child venerated as miraculous, which has received a Pontifical decree of coronation.
The church itself is a testament of a religious controversy rooting back from Marikina's early history wherein both the Jesuits and Augustinians fought over the ecclesiastical control of the area. The church is also known for featuring Metro Manila's longest Holy Week processions with around 87 floats as of 2023, and the third overall after the St. Augustine Parish in the town of Baliuag and the San Isidro Labrador Parish in the town of Pulilan, both located in the province of Bulacan and featuring at least 110 floats

      <p class="mrp-par">
        The park was developed as part of a rehabilitation program called Save the Marikina River Program by the Marikina city government. Launched in 1993, the program aims to reduce flooding and improve the Marikina riverbanks for better water discharge after a 1992 flood left 25% of the city under floodwater. The program involved building access roads to the banks to allow for the cleaning and clearing operations, clearing the banks of informal settlers and other encroachments, demanding the local industries along the riverbanks to set up water treatment facilities in order improve the river's water quality, planting various flora and building cultural, sports and other historical structures to draw residents back to the river.

       Built in 1969, the Marikina Sports Park was originally named the Rodriguez Sports Center after the governor at that time. It was then named after then Governor Isidro Santiago Rodriguez Sr. (1915-1992), when Marikina was still part of the Rizal Province.
Left to neglect over the years, it was taken over by Mayor Bayani Fernando and fully renovated by 2001. The Sports Complex boasts an Olympic-sized swimming pool, track and field facilities, a gymnasium, and courts for basketball, tennis, volleyball and badminton. Many local and international sporting and cultural events have been held here, including the 1972 ISF Men's World Championships, the 1973 Asian Athletics Championships, the 2005 Southeast Asian Games, the 2017 Philippines Football League inaugural games, and the 2014 ASEAN School Games.
